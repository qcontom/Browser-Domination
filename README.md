The initial concept for this game came from a comment on a post on reddit:

# Game Initial Concept

You, the user, controls an internet browser of your own making. Your goal is to get your product in front of as many people as you can, and if needed, force them to use your product. 

As your prowess increases, you gain different abilities. One of your unlockable abilities allows you to purchase competing browsers and disable or remove access to the browser.

Any good idle/incremental game needs a prestige system, which will unlock as you progress through the game.

This game is programmed using Javascript and HTML.
